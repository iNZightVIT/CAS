<h4> Introduction </h4>
Census Viewer is a web-based application that displays graphical output based on census data collected from secondary schools around New Zealand.

The application is divided into two vertical **panels**:

<h5> Input Panel </h5>
- You may specify the data set, sample size, and variables desired.
- You can download a sample of the data set by clicking "Download Data".
- Variables can be removed using the *delete* or *backspace* keys on your
keyboard.
- Press the *F5* key on your keyboard to refresh your session. This often resolves problems encountered during the analysis.

<h5> Output Panel </h5>
- A frequency table or bar chart based on the inputs you specified in the input panel are displayed here.
- Each table or chart is preceded by the survey question of interest and some information about the selected variable(s).
- Rows in the table can be rearranged in ascending (or descending) order by clicking the top right hand corner of either the second or third column (the cursor should change to a hand from a pointer).
- The bar chart can displayed either in *Grouped* (done by default) or *Stacked* form. This can be altered by clicking on the relevant buttons located at the top left hand corner of the chart.
- Press the *F5* key on your keyboard to refresh your session. This often resolves problems encountered during the analysis.
