Tabulator is a web application that displays graphical output based on
census data collected from secondary schools around New Zealand. The application is structured as follows:

<h5> Left hand panel </h5>
- Specify the desired data set, sample size, and up to two variables.
- Download a sample of the data set by clicking *Download
  Data*.

<h5> Right hand panel </h5>
- You can choose either a table of counts or bar chart that summarises
  the data.
- You can display the bar chart either in *grouped* (default) or
*stacked* form by clicking the button located at the top left hand
corner of the chart.
- The interval of numbers between *a* and *b* which **includes** *a* **but not** *b* is denoted by *[a, b)*.
- The interval of numbers between *a* and *b* which **includes both** *a* and *b* is denoted by *[a, b]*.

<h5> Help </h5>
